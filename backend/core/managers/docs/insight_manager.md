# Insight Manager Documentation

## Overview

The Insight Manager is responsible for generating insights from data through various analysis techniques, including pattern detection, trend analysis, anomaly detection, correlation analysis, and seasonality detection.

## Features

### Pattern Detection

- Uses DBSCAN clustering for pattern identification
- Configurable pattern lengths and similarity thresholds
- Pattern metrics:
  - Density: Measures how closely points are clustered (0-1)
  - Stability: Measures pattern consistency over time (0-1)
  - Coherence: Measures pattern internal consistency (0-1)

Example:

```python
{
    "patterns": {
        "pattern_0": {
            "size": 150,
            "center": [0.5, 0.3],
            "spread": [0.1, 0.05],
            "density": 0.85,
            "stability": 0.92,
            "coherence": 0.88
        }
    }
}
```

### Trend Analysis

- Seasonal decomposition of time series data
- Trend direction and magnitude identification
- Stationarity testing
- Seasonality detection
- Trend metrics:
  - Strength: R-squared of linear fit (0-1)

                "global_density": 0.65,
                "isolation": 0.85,
                "neighborhood_consistency": 0.7
            },
            "severity": 0.88
        }
    }
}
```

### Correlation Analysis

- Comprehensive correlation analysis between variables
- Correlation metrics:
  - Strength: Absolute correlation value (0-1)
  - Significance: Statistical significance using Fisher transformation

```python
{
    "correlations": [
        {
            "variable1": "sales",
            "variable2": "advertising",
            "correlation": 0.75,
            "strength": 0.75,
            "significance": 0.99,
            "stability": 0.85,
            "direction": "positive",
            "type": "strong"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Advanced seasonality detection and analysis
- Seasonality metrics:
  - Strength: Overall seasonality strength (0-1)
  - Period: Detected seasonal period
  - Consistency: Pattern consistency across periods (0-1)
  - Amplitude: Magnitude of seasonal variation (0-1)
  - Phase: Phase shift of seasonal pattern (0-1)
  - Significance: Statistical significance of seasonality
  - Type: None, weak, moderate, or strong
