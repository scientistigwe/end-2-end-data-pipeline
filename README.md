# My Assistant Data Pipeline

- An advanced ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system built on natural intelligence principles. Unlike conventional black-box etl systems, it features transparent processing with user-controlled decision points, making it ideal for clinical applications where expert oversight is essential. 

-

- The architecture combines loosely-coupled components with a central message broker, enabling both horizontal scaling and specialized domain adapters. The system replaces traditional ETL limitations with "Go/No-Go" checkpoints that ensure quality at every stage. This human-in-the-loop approach allows domain experts to validate insights and intervene when needed, while still leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning for pattern recognition. it offers Real-time visibility, detailed audit trails, and interactive dashboards while building stakeholder trust.

-

- it is designed with scalability in mind and can be readily extended for genomic data processing through specialized modules. This balanced approach to automation and human expertise accelerates time-to-insight while maintaining the high standards required for both service improvement and clinical research applications.---

## DEMO


## Overview

My Assistant Data Pipeline is a comprehensive data processing system designed to handle various data sources, perform quality checks, generate insights, and provide recommendations while maintaining complete transparency and user control at critical decision points.

## Key Features

- **Multi-stage Processing Pipeline**: Automated workflow from data reception through quality checks, analytics, and recommendations
- **User-controlled Decision Points**: Critical stages require user validation before proceeding
- **Component-based Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Transparent Processing**: Every step is logged, tracked, and accessible
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Robust error detection, recovery, and retry mechanisms
- **Scalable Design**: Built to handle growing data volumes with efficient resource management

## Core Architecture

- **Control Point Manager (CPM)**: Central orchestrator that manages workflow and decision points
- **Message Broker**: Handles communication between all system components
- **Staging Area**: Securely manages temporary storage of data during processing
- **Processing Departments**: Specialized components for each stage of data analysis

## Workflow

1. **Data Reception**: Files are uploaded and stored in the staging area
2. **Quality Analysis**: Data undergoes comprehensive quality checks
3. **Insight Generation**: Analytics processes extract meaningful insights
4. **Decision & Recommendation**: System generates actionable recommendations
5. **Reporting**: Final results are formatted and delivered to users

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Messaging**: Redis-based pub/sub system
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
