Build the multi-source adapter framework, starting with file processing and expanding to other sources



let me pick your brain on thisthis is my intent. conventional etl will take up data, cleanse and transform and load to a db.i am hoping for a bit advanced etl that will do the following:
1. take up data from 5 sources (api, file, stream, db, s3)
2. run a data quality analysis and generate report (ydata profile report and data quality issues report). share the report with the user.
3. notify the user at every stage of the process
4. make recommendations based on the reports to the user
5. take up the users decision and initiate the next action based on that (e.g. Action: handle missing values; next pipeline module to engage: Missing Value Module)
6. Generate Insight Analysis Report based on users inputed business goals.
7. commit the finished/refined data to a prefered storage system (possibly a db)
8. key here is the go-no-go approach where the user can pause, decide and engage/pilot the pipeline flow at any stage.
9. i want to do this without depending on advanced ML or AI features. I want the outcomes to be mirrored from the input dataNow my questions are:
is this a waste of time?
does it have any real life value implementing this tool?
am i geting it all wrong in my approach? is there a better way to achieve this aim?EditYour proposed advanced ETL system is both innovative and valuable. Let me explain why this approach has significant merit and real-world applications.
First, regarding the business value: Traditional ETL processes often operate as black boxes, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand data quality issues or make informed decisions about data handling. Your proposed system addresses this limitation by creating a transparent, interactive process that empowers users to make informed decisions about their data processing pipeline.
The system's value proposition is particularly strong in several scenarios:
Regulatory Compliance: In industries like healthcare, finance, and insurance, understanding data quality and maintaining decision audit trails is crucial. Your system's transparent, user-guided approach provides necessary documentation and control points that help meet compliance requirements.
Data Governance: Organizations increasingly need to demonstrate responsible data handling practices. The system's quality analysis and user decision points create a documented chain of data custody and transformation decisions, which is essential for proper data governance.
Business Intelligence: By incorporating business goals into the analysis process and generating targeted insights, the system bridges the gap between raw data processing and business value creation. This makes it more immediately useful than traditional ETL pipelines that focus solely on data movement and transformation.
Regarding your approach, it is fundamentally sound, but I would suggest some refinements:
Consider implementing a modular architecture where each processing stage (quality analysis, missing value handling, insight generation) operates as an independent service. This would allow you to add new capabilities or modify existing ones without disrupting the core pipeline flow.
For the user interaction component, consider implementing a workflow engine that can handle complex decision trees while maintaining pipeline state. This would allow for more sophisticated branching logic based on both automated analysis and user decisions.
The decision to avoid heavy reliance on ML/AI is sensible. By focusing on deterministic analysis and user-guided decisions, you create a more predictable and trustworthy system. This approach also makes the system more accessible to organizations that may not have extensive data science resources.
Your system's value lies in its ability to:

Enable informed decision-making through transparent data quality assessment
Provide actionable insights based on business context
Maintain data quality through user oversight
Create documented, repeatable data processing workflows
Support compliance and governance requirements

In terms of real-world applications, this system would be particularly valuable for:

Organizations dealing with multiple data sources that require careful quality control
Businesses needing to maintain clear audit trails of data processing decisions
Companies wanting to democratize data processing while maintaining control
Teams requiring flexible, business-goal-oriented data processing pipelines

The project is definitely not a waste of time. In fact, it addresses a significant gap in current ETL solutions by combining automated processing with human oversight in a way that adds real business value. The key to success will be maintaining the balance between automation and user control while ensuring the system remains performant and user-friendly.


Data flow tracking needs to be enhanced in the PipelineManager
The QualityManager needs more robust quality metrics
The DecisionManager needs clearer decision points
The InsightManager needs better business goal integration
The Coordinator needs stronger component coordination

enhancing is great but try keep it on the current track

orchestrator is the central hub that moderates all affairs right

currently i have different affairs orchestrator is suppose to manage
1. data sourcing and user interaction (managers carry data to the pipeline via orchestrator and recieve response via same route - 2-way traffic - file, api, s3, stream and db managers)
2. message broker handles communications between channels (orchestrator communicates with other modules via message broker. hence all critical system are registered with the broker)
3. Data processing unit handles data issue detector, analyser and resolver and feeds back to quality report. quality report then mantains 2-way communication with orchestrator via broker
4. Insight Analysis handles insight reporting based on the business goals and user decision and maintains communication with orchestrator via broker
5. conductor determines the right recipient or sender at each point (more like the diary keeper of orchestrator). hence before routing, orchestrator determines the right routing from conductor
6. staging area keeps in memory of everything

hence, there is atleast 6 channels of 2-way communication base manager (the bedrock of orchestration) need to open
